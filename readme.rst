What is BCL?

BCL stands for Ben's Compiled Language and it is just a fun hobby language I am making. It is inspired by python, a bit of rust, and any other language I know about.

VSCode highlighting

There is a folder called `syntax_highlighting`, inside there is a vsix file which you can right click to install. Just note that its a bit of a work in progress.

Documentation in the form of html docs can be found in the `docs` folder but will eventually be put on rtd.io
