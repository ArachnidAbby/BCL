# What is BCL?

BCL stands for Ben's Compiled Language and it is just a fun hobby language I am making. It is inspired by python.

The python inspiration is visible with function and variable declaration. Althought function declaration isn't *100%* the same.

# VSCode highlighting

There is a folder called `syntax_highlighting`, inside there is a vsix file which you can right click to install. Just note that it's a bit of a work in progress.

# Documentation

Documentation in the form of html docs can be found in the `docs` folder but will eventually be put on the rtd.io website.

The documentation was started so early to make sure I didn't forget what the language is supposed to look like.
